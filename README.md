Rewrite of [POPCO](https://github.com/mars0i/popco) in Clojure.

All of this code is copyright (c) 2013, 2014 by Marshall Abrams.  All rights
reserved.  That means that the code is not really free for anyone else's
use.  This is just until I figure out what license to license it under.
Given the number of license options, that could take some time, but
since the code isn't very useful at this point, I'm not restricting the
utility of this code to others.  Please be assured that I will at the
very least make the code available for use in academic research, when
it's potentially useful.

Feel free to read the code, and please contact me if you want to use
it or get involved in some way.
