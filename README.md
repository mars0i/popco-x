popco2
=======

Cultural transmission with analogy-influenced biases.  Rewrite of
[popco](https://github.com/mars0i/popco) in Clojure.  
This repository was previously called "popco-x".

is source code in src/java that was written by other authors, and that
is released under different licenses.)

This is a work in progress.  Please see the readme for
[popco](https://github.com/mars0i/popco) (scroll down) for an overview
of what popco2 is supposed to do.

In some documents I refer to the original popco as "popco1".
