=======

Repo for experiments in support of a rewrite of [POPCO](https://github.com/mars0i/popco).

All of this code is copyright (c) 2013 by Marshall Abrams.  All rights
reserved.  That means that the code is not really free for anyone else's
use.  This is just until I figure out what license to license it under.
Given the number of license options, that could take some time, but
since the code isn't very useful at this point, I'm not restricting the
utility of this code to others.  Please be assured that I will at the
very least make the code available for use in academic research, when
it's potentially useful.
