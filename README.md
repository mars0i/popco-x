All of this code is copyright (c) 2013 by Marshall Abrams.  It's not
free for anyone else's use for any purpose until I figure out what
license to license it under.  Given the number of license options, that
could take some time, but since the code isn't very useful at this
point, that doesn't restrict the utility of this code to others.  Please
be assured that I will at the very least make this code available for
use in academic research.
