TODO IN PROGRESS

Goal is to have peasant spiritual propns diffuse, and gradually enter into
the analogy net, and thus gradually come to be selected in contrast to
spiritual brahmanic propns, in response to worldly-peasant propns.

SHOULDN'T IT BE WORLDLY PEASANT PROPNS THAT ARE PERCEIVED, NOT SPIRITUAL PROPNS?

innov is the person who's supposed to diffuse the spiritual peasant propns.
she's the innovator.  Wait--is that necessary?  the True Believer and the
Naysayer are already doing that.  Um, unless I restrict them to only asserting
non-SP propns.

Question: What do I want the pundits to do???

Q: How did I do this in the Sanday sims in "Moderate Role"?  A: I gave
most members of pop all propositions except the ones to be diffused (the
earth origin propns).  Then for each earth origin propn, added one indiv
that had all of the propns that the other indvivs had, plus a unique
earth origin propn.  These played the pundit role.  The diffusion
happened while the contrary worldly analog, hunting, was salient.  For
everyone.  Then I switched the salience from hunting to parenting, and
the earth origin propns kicked in.

The thing is, I want the propns to diffuse, but I don't want them to
necessarily have high activation.  I just want them available in the
analogy net.  They have to have a certain amount of activation in 
order to get uttered.  But I want perception of the environment
to be the driver of proposition activation.  I don't have these
things separated.  Then again, I don't think the diffused propns
were perceived in the Sanday model 2 simulation.
Yep. "... they do end up getting activations other than zero, due to 
mappings in which they participate imperfectly."

OK so maybe this is what I want:
innov, The innovator is just another peasant, except that she has the new
spiritual peasant ideas as well as the other three domains.

This will work for the no-bias case, I think, but maybe not for the
success bias case, since then she will have a complete set of spiritual
propns.  Won't that make her more successful, i.e. give her higher values
of worldly peasant propns?  Well not if I make success contingent on 
the local group, but that's a later stage of modeling.

So maybe I need to do it the Sanday model 2 way, and split the spiritual
propns up between diff indivs.
