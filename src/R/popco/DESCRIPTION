Description: popco2 is a framework written in Clojure for constructing agent-based simulations in which agents communicate beliefs, and each agent's degrees of beliefs are influenced by what other beliefs they have, and what those beliefs degrees of beliefs are.  This R package collects R functions written to aid in the analysis of data generated by POPCO. This software is copyright 2013, 2014, 2015 by Marshall Abrams, and is distributed under the Gnu General Public License version 3.0 as specified in the file LICENSE.  The Sept. 2014 version is essentially the same as what was in popco1 (the Common Lisp version), but I incremented the package version number anyway.
