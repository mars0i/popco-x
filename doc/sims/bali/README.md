Notes toward analogies for interaction with Lansing-Kremer-Janssen
NetLogo simulation of Balinese irrigation coordination.  See also any
.md files in src/sims/bali, and especially see docs in my [bali
repository](https://github.com/mars0i/bali/tree/master/doc), which
contains variants of the Lansing-Kremer-Janssen simulation and
architectural notes about interaction between NetLogo and Popco.

initialnts*.md contain brainstorming notes.  Don't expect them to make
sense or be correct.
