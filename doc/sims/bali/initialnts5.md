bhutakala destory the kingdom  
bhutakala destroy the rice

but the rice is not just rice, it's part of life
my life, our life

s/rice/kingdom/ for royal folk.

So I want a match to rice beliefs among the farmers, but not to
kingdom beliefs.

But so far, rice beliefs and kingdom beliefs are completely analogous,
and so popco will happily match kingdom beliefs, if they exist; there's
really no difference between rice beliefs and kingdom beliefs, as far as
popco is concerned.  So I need to add propositions that make them
disanalogous.

Maybe stuff about farming and terraces and water.  
And stuff about history and the end of the world.  
Or maybe about the royal court?

There are so many parallels between the royal conception and the
rice-farming conceptions, it seems.  That's the *point*--that's how it
was so easy to transfer.  For substitution to occur.  i.e. by
hypothesis.

Maybe focus on wars etc.  Maybe on the coming of the Dutch.

##### What's different:

* The people to whom it applies

	* Royal:
		* There is not equality--not toward peasants, and
		  not even within the royalty.
		* There is not democracy.
	* Peasant:
		* There is equality (within each sex, at least)
		* There is democracy (within subaks)


* The endeavors to which it applies

	* Royal:
		* state needs management, leadership

	* Peasant:
		* rice grows
		* rice needs water
		* rice needs tending (kind of like management)
		* water requires sharing (cf. equality, democracy)


* Outside dangers

	* Royal:
		* Other negaras
		* Groups coming from across the ocean

	* Peasant:
		* Rice pests
			* are animals, insects
			* grow and spread naturally
