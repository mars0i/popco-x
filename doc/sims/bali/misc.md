As of 11/17/2014:

There are 57 propositions.

The Bali analogy net is 219x219.  (Compare: crime3 was 262x262.)
i.e. there are 218 regular nodes, plus SEMANTIC.

It feels as if Bali's threegroups is faster than crime3's.  Maybe
because the analogy net is smaller, even though there are more
propositions?
