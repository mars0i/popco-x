	ob-pest is a Pest

	ob-worldly-state-of-disorder is Disorderly

	ob-worldly-state1 is Worldly

	Causal-if blahblah is Bhutakala, then blahblah causes disorder?:

	practical water is holy water
	water is practical
	water is holy
	water is of the gods

	water is blessing from gods

	water nourishes rice
		water nourishes rice physically
		water nourishes rice spiritually (i.e. holy water)

	rice nourishes people
		rice nourishes people physically
		rice nourishes people spirtually
			(when they are part of the holy order)

	water nourishes people
		water nourishes people physically
		water nourishes people spiritually (holy water)

	water blessed by local priest

	offerings return to gods/ancestors

	ritural exhibits, evokes, increases spirtual order.
	ritural exhibits, evokes, increases worldly order.

	bhutakala cause inner disorder in people
	bhutakala cause social disorder among people

	rats cause disorder in rice
	rats cause disorder in (social) nature
	rats cause disorder in human food supply
	rats cause disorder in the fields

Therefore rats break the jewel-like character of the mountainside, of
the world.

(if rats are already considered bhutakala then do a spirit-bhutakala
vs. rat bhutakala distinction.)

rice holy, water holy by local offerings  

### vs. alternative religious tradition:
	
vs. holy by Brahmans.

it's about order and control in Brahmans etc.  In the leaders, the
elite.

	Offerings help self-mastery of elites.
	Ritual helps self-mastery.
	Self-mastery is inner order.
	Inner order is universal order.
	Disorder is inevitable.
	But by inner order, the king can slow it down.

OK, so here I've got a contrast and parallel between elites and
farmers.  Both should play a role in analogous claims about order and
holiness.  And water can be a part of both.

But the brahmans won't have a role for rice.  So that's one
disanalogy.  So if you have a role for rice connected to your analogy,
then it's going to work better in the rice-farming context.

Also, holy water among the elites (they have that, right?) isn't going
to evoke the role of water in farming.  (Water is one of the links
between rice and the spiritual world.)

Nor do the Brahman have a role for the interference of bhutakala in
social harmony, I think, since social harmony per se isn't part of the
focus of the elites.  At least not as I read Lansing and Geertz.  Hmm
although there is a lot of social order in the Court, and in relations
between lineage groups.

	The court creates order.
	The subak creates order.

	The king creates order.
	The priest creates order.
