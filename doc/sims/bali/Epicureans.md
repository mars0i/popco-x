Notes on the no-bias "Epicurean gods" runs
====

Re sims/bali/epicureans.clj

In this simulation, there is a pundit and 40 "Epicurean gods" (see a
translation of *De Rerum Natura* by Lucretius), i.e. individuals who are
aware only of the realm of the spiritual, and have no interest in anything
worldly.

The result is that all beliefs are influenced only by what pundit says,
and pundit only speaks of all spiritual matters.  So the outcome is that
all spiritual beliefs have activations close to 1.  The scatter plot
puts all run means in the upper right corner.

From this point of view, the effect of having a
worldly-proposition-based bias on spiritual beliefs is to *pull down*
some spiritual activations.  i.e. the propns to which you have a bias
will still have high activations, on average--almost as if you are an
Epicurean god in that domain.  But the other propositions--the ones in
the contrary spiritual domain--those will (should) have their
activations pulled negative.
