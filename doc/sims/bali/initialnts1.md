Raw initial notes working toward Bali analogies in popco.  
(formerly analogies.nt1 in papers/Bali on hard drive)  

Page and chapter references are to *Perfect Order: Recognizing
Complexity in Bali* by J. Stephen Lansing, Princeton University Press
2006 except where noted.  Reading the chapters mentioned below will
help you make sense of these notes.

There is also useful background information in Lansing's earlier (2nd ed.
later) book *Priests and Programmers*, and in Clifford Geertz's *Negara:
The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali*.

-----------------------------------

Marshall's copy of *Perfect Order* has dog ears on special pages, and
postcard bookmarks on very special pages.

Some key starting point pages in *Perfect Order*: 130-131, 137
There's also relevant bg info in Priests and Programmers, e.g. some
basic stuff starting on page 44.

(*Perfect Order* is a better source for analogical material than
*Priests and Programmers* or any of the articles that I've looked at so
far.)

-----------------------------------

Remember the goal is to make orderly behavior analogous to something
spiritual.  
Something like that.

-----------------------------------

This is based on Perfect Order (PO) chapters 4 and 2:

>	It's holy water not all of it--only the blessed stuff  
>	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but still:  
>	Belongs to goddess/god  
>	One god/ess per subak  
>	One holy temple per subak  
>	therefore respect temples process etc  
>	the water is spiritual.  

The geographic/interactive structure/network of the temples, gods is
analogous to that of the water network.

There's more--perhaps more relevant--in chapter 5.

-----------------------------------

>	order is good    
>	humans push toward order, and should, as Hegel says (PO ch5)  
>	this is the nature of the universe  
>	good comes from order, harmony  
>	making the world  
>	and self  
>	like a jewel  
>	both at the static physical level   
>	(paddies on the mountainside in the moonlight)  
>	and over time  
>	and at a higher-level  
>		i.e. pests  
>		lack of growth  
>		is not a jewel  
>	order inside  
>	causes order outside  
>	and probably vice versa  
>	(or maybe order inside *is* order outside)
>	  
>	this is wrt to people as rough equals  
>	not wrt castes as in the Indian tradition  

-----------------------------------

from chapter 5:

>	pests are disorder  
>	high yield is order  
>	good irrigation is order  
>	  
>	strife is disorder  
>	  
>	human disorder causes worldly, farming disorder  
>	worldly disorder causes human  
>	  
>	bhutakala cause human disorder,  
>	or are caused by it,  
>	or are it  

humans (farmers) must work to control disorder:

>	inside humans  
>		i.e. controlling bhutakala  
>	in social relations  
>		in subaks  
>		between subaks  
>	in the world/farming  

if they don't, disorder will come. it's always the default tendency

>	order is good  
>	disorder is bad  


vs.
other stuff about disorder, but it's all in control of emotions  
etc among Brahmans  
and nothing among farmers  

-----------------------------------

What about rituals?  The rituals represent the world as ordered.
And maybe also require ordered social relations to create them well.
Or maybe doing them well causes ordered social relations.

Well I think probably that doing them well certainly encourages order in the
world, either/both via the non-human spiritual world, and though
inculcating order within people who watch the rituals and who peform
the rituals.

At the same time, I suspect that performing the rituals well requires
internal order (but that's a way to encourage it).  [however, this
intuition comes from an no-reason-to-consider-trustworthy source that I
happened to find on the web.]  
i.e. there's a feedback relationship.  Maybe.

The rituals are also fed by the farming, in that ritual require
resources from subaks, villages, individuals.

-----------------------------------

We are in harmony.  My life is ordered.  The fields are ordered.  My
subak is ordered.  The village is ordered.  The rituals are ordered, and
celebrate the gods, and suppress the bhutakala.  Not just the rituals and
art, but the fields are mandala, an expression and celebration of order.
It's all a mandala.  We fit into it.  Into a world of order.  And it's
good.  It's a good life.  It's emotionally good, and resourcewise
good.

This I desire.  I celebrate.

(One of the things I found online about Balinese prayer,
http://www.filosbali.net/BalinesePrayer.htm, emphasized bringing oneself
to an internal state of peacefulness and harmony as part of ritual
offerings.  This seems to contain information for tourists produced by
people who've visited Bali.  No idea whether this is trustworthy.  (I
could easily imagine that it was influenced by any of several
alternative spirituality trends, or Indian Hinduism, etc.)

cf. Eiseman vol. I, p. 53 there is a description of the state of mind
necessary for making water holy.

[an aside: contrast this with recent *1984*-inspired teen movies like
"Divergent" and "The Giver".]

-----------------------------------

In the Brahman tradition, the order is otherworldly, and internal, and
requires formal study and formal practice.  And guidance from those
who've done it before.

In the mountainside tradition, it's also otherworldly and internal,
but also worldly.  The symbols both are in the world (e.g. art,
rituals) and are the world (i.e. fields).  [A purely etic distinction,
once the metaphors are internalized.]

-----------------------------------

cf. Geertz _Negara_ p.13: The royal court is through its harmony,
what makes the world, the state harmonious.

What I want to do is to take that idea and let it slip into a folk
analogue of it.  And then have belief in that be what damps the noise.

And that part of why that analogy is appealing (rather than the royal
version) is that it is analogous with what they are dealing this.

Worried this is a bit subtle, for popco.

I'm kind of talking about a substitution in a sentence (sentences).  
i.e. substitute folk or village or subak for court.

OK well that that means is that there has to be an analogy between the
court and the subak or village or individual.  So that you can get
transfer, i.e. selection/reinforcement of analogous beliefs about the
subak/individual/etc.  Since popco doesn't allow real substitutions:
It just chooses among already existing beliefs.  (Need to explain that
clearly in presentations, papers.)

Harmony in the royal court creates harmony in the state (the negara).

	State is F.
	State is G.

Harmony in the subak creates harmony in farming.

	Subak is A.
	Subak is B.

Harmony in the individual creates harmony in the world.

	Individual is A.
	Individual is B.

-----------------------------------

1. priest is harmonious wrt spiritual
2. farmer/village/subak is harmonious wrt spiritual
3. farmer/village/subak is harmonious wrt farming  
[not real popco proposition candidates, but sketch ideas]

As stated, analogy between 1 and 2 is equally good wrt 2 and 3.

But 2:3 is better than 1:2 simply because of predicate identities.
So if you shift to 2, rather than 1, you get better reinforcement of 3.

If I can just build more of the spiritual practice
and more of the irrigation practice
into these, then it will work

-----------------------------------

	fields without pests is good.
	fields without pests is harmonious.
	good is harmony.
	fields with high yield is good.

something about fallow fields being part of the harmony.
to every season ...

	farmers are fields
	farmers work fields
	subaks work fields
	subaks manage water
	water is spiritual
	water management is spiritual
	good water management is good spiritual
	good water management is harmonious
	good spiritual = harmonious, and vice versa
	harmonious is conducive to good
	what is good is harmonious

harmony and disharmony in:  
people management  
individual person's psyche management  
subak management  

	democracy in subaks is harmony
	lack of strife is harmony
	agreement is harmony

	rats are in confict with rice
	rats are in confict with people
	rice is good for people

	harmony gets rid of rats.
	irrigation harmony gets rid of rats.
	spiritual harmony gets rid of rats.

	rats should be given some due, though

-----------------------------------

Part of the story that I would hypothesize, is that there was a
(Hofstadterian) slippage at the start.  There was a substitution of
subak or farmer for brahman/priest, because they are all people--there
is an analogy between brahmans and farmers (and therefore subaks),
and there are analogies between their relations.

So how about:

	Priest is F1, F2, etc.: priest/brahman-specific properties.
	Priest is G1, G2, etc.: properties that all humans have.
	Priest bears relationships R1, R2 to X (world, perfect heaven, something)

	Farmer is G1, G2, etc.
	Farmer is H1, H2, etc.: properties that are specific to farmers/subaks
and then the slip:
	Farmer bears relationships R1, R2 to <their world>.

The point is that the history is not *just* competition between two
analogues.  The history is the creation of a new, competing analogue,
because it was analogous to the old one.

Messy for me.  For POPCO.  Might work better with Thagard's
substitution model.  Or CopyCat ....  
[I wonder if you could hack CopyCat to replace sequential etc.
relationships with other ones.]

But it's not just that I'm really dealing with analogues of analogues.
It's worse: Because my competing analogues are very similar.  They're
... analogous.  That's a problem.  POPCO is not good with that.
And given their similarity, it may seem very weird to construct them
as if they were different.

Still, I wonder if I can do what I need just by focusing on the
brahman-specific and farmer-specific properties.  Maybe compress the
F's into a single proposition or something.

Part of the problem is that one of the draws is just that "we" are
farmers, so we place value in appropriating the priestly analogies and
repurposing them.  Maybe it needs H&T's purpose system.  (Can I do that
just with semantic specs?)

Well, look: For the priests, the stuff in the world that needs to
match the analogy is there.  But *that* stuff is not a part of the
farmer's lives.  Not a part of their needs, .... their purposes.
Whereas for the farmers, there is a different worldly analogue.

Maybe what I should be selecting is the world analogue?  Not the
religious one?  No, that doesn't make sense.  The world is as it is.

Yet the world changes when you apply the religious analogue.  i.e. the
propositions about it do.  You get different cognitive patterns about
the world.

Maybe the only selective force is the reinforcement from the
Lansing-Kremer-Janssen model.

Maybe the competition is *not* the priestly analogues.  It's something
different--something that preceded the Hinduish stuff.  (So what was
that?  Do we have any idea?  Maybe something from a nearby island??
It doesn't really matter what it is, but I need something.)

-----------------------------------

Maybe something with the two personas, Durga and Uma, of Siwa's wife?

-----------------------------------

p. 150 there is an explicit comparison of the brahmanic and the
farmers' spiritual goals:

The king strives for "superhuman" perfection, and if he fails, he
loses it all: He loses his kingdom.
(Question: Does this fit with the idea of gradual loss and
dissipation, as described by Geertz in _Negara_?)

For the subak members, it's not all or nothing.  You are always going
to lose, sometimes, and you always have to work to recover.  It's a
recurrent, persistent, process.

The same is true with pests and yields, etc.  And you have to allow
some failure--some pests--that's part of the process.  But the
well-regulated subak, the harmonious one, is one in which the
bhutakala, the bad spirits--as rats or as witches or as other bad
elements within people--are kept in check (not vanquished completely).

So what if that is the focus of the contrast?: Between the all or
nothing striving for perfection, and the persistent, recurrent,
struggle for partial mastery against the constant, inexorable threat
of chaos.

Both versions are about harmony and mastery of the self, and its
effects on the world.  But one is about complete mastery and
perfection, and the other is about managing the chaos of life.

So page 150 is very important.  That's going to be the key.


It would be nice if these alternatives could *both* be linked to general
claims about harmony and mastery of the self.  And let that map.  What
would be nice if despite being linked to a common set of propositions,
that one set from the contrasting propositions gets chosen.

Or maybe I should just have the contrasting propositions.

Or I could have the two different versions of the mastery-and-harmony
propositions--one for brahmans/kings/priests, and one for the folk.
But make sure that each is linked to its related propositions.  (Do
that with the predicates and individuals.  Maybe with semantic specs.)

It might be worth adding negative semantic links between the Brahmanic
vs folk harmony/mastery propositions.  (It's not that they can't both
be true, but they can't both be salient.)

-----------------------------------

	For all x, if x is a Bhutakala, then x is F.
		[of course I don't have quantifiers in popco.]
	Rats are bhutakala.  Or: If x is a Rat, then x is a Bhutakala.
	Witches are bhutakala.  (etc.)
	Jealousy is bhutakala.
	Greed is bhutakala.
	Envy is bhutakala.
	Anger is bhutakala.

Something like that--maybe.

-----------------------------------

	Psychic/spiritual disorders can be ameliorated.
	Pestilence can be ameliorated.
	Water stress can be ameliorated.
[But in the Brahman system if it's disorder, it's done.]

	Psychic/spiritual disorders can be followed by improvement.
	Pestilence can be followed by improvement.
	Water stress can be followed by improvement.
[But in the Brahman system if it's disorder, it can't.]

With the water cult, there's a sequence: 

deterioration, improvement through efforts, deterioration sneaks in.
recurse.

cf. crime virus/beast

-----------------------------------

	I strive to be a jewel.
	disorder always returns; tries to return
	we are good, happy when harmonious.
	when we are jewels
	but the pests always come.
	and the bhutakala always come.
	and our failings always come.
	in the subak,
	in the individual.

	the disruption of the harvest, of the growing process
	is a disruption of the jewel that life can be

-----------------------------------

	ordered != disordered
	productive fields are ordered
	beautiful fields are ordered
	pest-filled fields are disordered
	bhutakala cause disorder
	bhutakala are/cause personal spiritual disorder
	personal spiritual disorder causes subak-level disorder,  
		i.e.: not(fields are ordered)


	strive for personal/spiritual order
	strive for subak-level/spiritual order
	strive for rice-growing order

-----------------------------------

Let there be two spiritual schemes.  One of them emphasizes
personal and subakian spiritual order.  The other doesn't.

And let personal/subakian order be such that it makes it more likely
that you do what is best wrt coordination with neighbors.  So e.g. if
you would get more in the short-term by not coordinating, the
spiritual order religious tradition makes it more likely that you
don't do that.

-----------------------------------

The water temples both manage water distribution and manage certain
rituals.  The practical and ritual practice are viewed as intrinsically
connected.  This means that the water distrbution map is also a
spiritual map, and keeping disorder in check in the water temple system
keeps disorder in check across the whole mountainside.

-----------------------------------

Spiritual practices provide *spiritual* control over bhutakala.
But, I claim, also reinforce ways of thinking that suppress the forces
within people that lead them to act out.

MAYBE I NEED TO KNOW SOME OF THE PRAYERS/INVOCATIONS ETC.

-----------------------------------

I think that bhutakala are:

1. in the world as spirits, monsters, etc.
2. in the world as pests (rats, etc.)
3. in persons as jealousy, witch-ness, etc.

Is this correct??

-----------------------------------

In the end this has to hook up to enhance successful coordination.

	cooperation is orderly
	getting along is orderly
	democracy is orderly
	scheming is disorderly

	conflict between people is disorderly

	conflict about water is disorderly

	contentious disagreement about water is disorderly

And then make lack of conteniousness or something like that an
enhancement to cooperation--i.e. it's the noise suppressor in copying.
i.e. in the combined popco/netlogo model, we have a test for the
activation value of one or more contentiousness/orderliness propositions
(maybe only one, but then it should end up being connected to all the
others), and if it's high, suppress the noise.  i.e. connect that popco
state to the noise-suppressor state in NetLogo.  So rather than
religion/noise-suppression being transmitted directly, it's imposed as
a result of communication in NetLogo.

The last examples above can be expressed as a property of a proposition,
e.g.:

	x is in conflict with y  (propn name: c-x-y)
	c-x-y is disorderly

or:
	My subak is contending with some subak over water. (s-s-w)
	s-s-w is disorderly.

Something like that.

(Q: Is this necessarily relationship symmetric?)

-----------------------------------

Rituals emphasize order, mandalic structures (see both Lansing, and
Geertz _Negara_).

They are organized physically wrt the practical landscape.  For each
structure, substructure, etc. in the water distribution system, rice
paddies, etc., there is a little shrine.  So the order you are
emphasizing is order at all levels of those practices and practical
concerns.

how can this be described for popco?

it's not just order expressed propositionally in obvious thoughts.

	there is order in this mandala
	the mandala is symmetric
	what is symmetric is orderly
	the mandala places x in relation to y (in relation to z) ...
	  in way that's orderly
	(I'd have to go into the details of the Mandala)

	the mandala shows order in the spiritual world
		wrt the field
		wrt the collection of fields
		wrt the small canal
		wrt the large canal
		wrt the dam
		  i.e. wrt the subak
		  or what the subak decided
		  i.e. the subak creates the order in the subak
		  in the dam
		  in the dam/subak system
		we are a mandala
