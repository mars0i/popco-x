Notes on runs of threegroups.clj mid-November 2014
====

These use "worldly" propns to bias "spiritual" propns, just as in the
crime3 simulations.  I combined 100 runs from bali1.df and 100 runs
from bali2.df to use a total of 200 runs to construct bali.df, and to
generate WorldBiasesScatter11192014.pdf.

Although there's clearly an effect of the biases, the odd thing
is that on the spiritual peasant dimension, the worldly peasant
condition is no further to the right than the worldly brahman
condition, even though on the spiritual brahmanic dimension, the
worldly brahmnic mean is pulled up..

Note that as expected, you get the same effect as in crime3, that there
is more freedom to vary in the dimension that's not under bias, but the
worldly brahmanic bias seems to allow less freedom in this respect than
the worldly peasant bias.  Hmm.  Almost like it's pushed up on the
left.

Maybe this has to do with the fact that in my mid-Nov. 2014 set of bali
propositions, the *contrary* sets of propositions are pushed down to a
lesser degree than in the crime3 propositions.  This is apparent in
hermits09988846.pdf.

OK.  In crime3, the number of propositions in each domain was roughly
the same: 12 or 13.  In bali at this point, there are significantly
fewer propositions in the Brahmanic domains than in the peasant
domain.  I think that's the issue.  So there is less variation
*possible* in the Brahmanic domains.  Plus, more propositions means
that they pull more in the negative dimension.  So if you normalized
this effect, the peasant mean should be farther to the right.

So I should either come up with a way of normalizing this effect, or
kludge it by making the number of propositions in the brahmanic and
peasant domains roughly the same.

(Note that the mean for the "both" condition is pulled down.
That's an effect of having more biasing propositions.)
