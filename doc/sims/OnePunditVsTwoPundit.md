One vs two pundits for testing bias
====

If you want to run a simulation examining two different biases, like
crime3 or bali, there are two simple ways to do it.

1. Have a single pundit, who fully believes all of the beliefs in the
   analogue that is supposed to be affected by the biases.
   Communication between this individual and everyone else is then
   biased by different analogies.  You might also think of this pundit
   as the world--as the witness of the senses, so to speak.

2. Have two pundits, one who is the pundit from above, and the other
   who fully disbelieves all of the propositions in the same analogue.

1 might seem more natural, but it means that the natural center of
gravity of bias plots is the upper right corner, i.e. the natural
state is to simply fully believe everything.

For 2, the natural center of gravity should be the center of the bias
plot--i.e. 0 degree of belief in anything.
