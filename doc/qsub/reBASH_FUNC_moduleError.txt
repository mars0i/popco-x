You can ignore that. It comes from using the #$ -V argument. With that argument, SGE tries to send all of your environment variables, etc... to the job, which also includes the module() function.

The error is harmless and SGE doesn't provide any sane work around other than to use "#$ -v" instead of "#$ -V" to selectively pass variables to the job instead passing all.

Subject: [support] -bash: error importing function definition for `BASH_FUNC_module()'

Hi,

I just started using Cheaha again after six months or a year of not using it.  Should I worry about the error message:

-bash: error importing function definition for `BASH_FUNC_module()'

that I get in my stderr output file when I use qsub to submit jobs?  This is new.

I know that this is probably a FAQ.  If there's somewhere I should have searched for an answer, please let me know.  I didn't find/couldn't remember where that would be.  

Thanks!


Marshall
