persist-wt-mat
enduring-wt-mat    [sounds like the weight matrix persists]
endure-wt-mat
persevere-wt-mat   ["persevere" eh.]
perduring-wt-mat   [eh. I'm a philosopher.]
perdure-wt-mat     [eh. I'm a philosopher.]
persevering-wt-mat ["persevering" eh.]
lingering-wt-mat   [the weight matrix "lingers"?]

The winner as of 4/28/2014:
