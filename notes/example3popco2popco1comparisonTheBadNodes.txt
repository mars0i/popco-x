NODES SHOWING POPCO2 - POPCO1 DIFFERENCE > 0.01:

	jo_V-ica->-v-ipa->v-na
	jo_V-qp->-v-ipa->v-na
These last two have links to exactly the same propns:
	([31 :CV-ip->-cv-rpa->cv-na] [37 :CV-sa->-cv-rpa->cv-na])
in popco1, the links are the same, although the weights are
a little bit off from those in popco2.  But close.

	jo_V-ia->v-ha
That one has one link in both popco2 and popco1:
	([26 :CV-ca->cv-ha])
The weights are pretty close.

	jo_B-cpb->-b-abp
This one has a single link in both versions of popco:
	([16 :CB-cpc->-cb-vpp 0.1464044113587105])
Weight is close but not identical in popco1.


NOTE: I've verified, using test/crime3.clj, that the analogy links
are indeed the same in popco1 and popco2.  That suggests that either
there's something wrong with the process of updating the propn net
from the analogy net, there's something wrong with the settling
algorithm, or (most likely) the discrepancies are solely due to
float founding differences because the calculations in popco1 and
popco2 use completely different algorithms.

These just duplication those nodes in jo that job and jov are capable of:
	job_B-cpb->-b-abp
	jov_V-ia->v-ha
	jov_V-ica->-v-ipa->v-na
	jov_V-qp->-v-ipa->v-na
