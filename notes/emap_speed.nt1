emap! doesn't seem faster than emap in vectorz, ndarray, or clatrix,
even if you don't include the cost of copying a matrix first (which can
be slow in some of these).  persistent-vector uses ndarray for mutable
arrays.

This is on the order of 50% slower than (emap! posify M):

	(dotimes [i 1000] 
	  (dotimes [j 1000]
	    (mset! N i j 
	      (posify 
	        (mget N i j)))))

Changing N to M in the final line doesn't change the speed.
