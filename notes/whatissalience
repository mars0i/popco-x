Salience means: available for inference.

(It's what Sperber and Wilson call an "assumption", I think.)

This is why it's justified to not add component propns when you add a
propn: The components aren't salient, available for inference, even
though they're there.

Well, but salience is different from being there as a node.  If P goes
high, its components will tend to go high--*if* they exist.  And then
they're likely to be communicated.  But not if they don't yet exist.
Hmm.

-------------------------------------------------

The thing is, if you bel P, but you don't care about P, or you don't
bother thinking about it or remembering it, or you don't consider it
relevant to the situation (here there are bg things that could be
modeled), then it's as if it's not there.  It's a zero-activation belief
for the purposes of *what you're thinking about now*, or for the
purposes of *what you're thinking about, when you think about a certain
domain*.

But if its negation is salient, then *that* is relevant to what you're
thinking about now.
