Salience means: available for inference.

This is why it's justified to not add component propns
when you add a propn: The components aren't salient,
available for inference, even though they're there.

Well, but salience is different from being there as a node.  If P goes
high, its components will tend to go high--*if* they exist.  And then
they're likely to be communicated.  But not if they don't yet exist.
Hmm.
